          <h2> Ways to implement Preprocessing <br> (client-side vs Server-side)</h2>
        
          <p> <b>Preprocessing</b> Sass preprocessor are for when the normal CSS stylesheets are larger, more complex and become harder
             to maintain in website development. Preprocessing allows for use of variables, if/else statements, for/while/each loops, 
             inheritance, operators, interpolation, mixins, and other dynamic features, then compile the code to plain CSS that web 
             browsers can interpret. <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

        <h2> Mechanisims used in SASS: <br> mixins, variables, functions </h2>
      
        <p> <b>Mixins</b> lets you create CSS code that is to be reused throughout the website and make it easy to avoid using 
          non-semantic classes like .float-left , and to distribute collections of styles in libraries. A mixin is defined with the 
          @mixin directive, is a style of software development, in which units of functionality are created in a class and then mixed 
          in with other classes. 

          <p> <b>Varialbes</b> are a way to store information that you can re-use later and are only available at the level of nesting 
            where they are defined. store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass uses 
            the $ symbol to make something a variable.  

            <p> <b>Functions</b> allow you to define complex operations on SassScript values that can re-use throughout the stylesheet. 
              Functions make it simple to extract out standard formulae and practices in a decipherable manner. The function helps in 
              computing calculations and return values in SASS / SCSS. Functions are defined using the @function at-rule, written as 
              at function name (arguments...). So, code the function by using the @function keyword, followed by name, a pair of 
              parentheses for arguments, and set of curly braces. <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

      <h2> How I implemented SASS Preprocessing</h2>
    
      <p> <b>Example:</b> shows how visitors navigate through your website from the first
         page to the last page. This report alls for the visualization of a users journey through the 
         site, or the path visitors take used to achieve their goals. The report also identifies
        problem points, or obstacles in the site preventing visitors from accomplishing their tasks. 
        Issues like confusing navigation, irrelevant content, or technical issues are recognized in 
        the behavior flow report. <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
